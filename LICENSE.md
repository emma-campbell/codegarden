This source code is provided without warranty or liability, and may be distributed or modified as needed.

I share it with the purpose of helping others learn. If you'd like to use it as a template, please do! There are a few stipulations though.

1. Remove all content written by me, found in the `/content/posts/` directory
2. Remove all of my personal information (my about me page, etc).
3. Please, please, _please_, provide attribution. Using open-source code is how we help write better software, but attribution still benefits all users of open source. If you are interesting in learning more about attribution, check out this [article](https://nexb.com/oss-attribution-best-practices/)

If you so happen to find anyone that didn't follow my three requirements, please feel free to contact me to let me know. I don't mind sharing, but I do appreciate the acknowledgement.

That's it. That's the license. Short, simple, and sweet.
