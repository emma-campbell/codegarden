Almost every developer dreams of creating a stylish and functional blog for sharing their journeys about learning in tech.

# Content Management Enginnering

## MDX

MDX is a framework that allows you to use Markdown style markup in tandem with JSX (React) components. The concept allows for more interactive style blogging as you can include JS powered components in your own articles (code examples that you can edit and run in real time,)

```bash
yarn create next-app
```

```
