Moose’s separation anxiety is one of the most difficult things I’ve ever delt with as a pet owner or even within my personal life. I grew to be anxious leaving the home for even a few minutes to take the recycling downstairs, terrified that he would get into something he shouldn’t or harm himself.

*Disclaimer: I am not a expert in canine separation anxiety. All items in this list are from my own experience and what worked best for my dog. If you are struggling with your dog’s anxiety, reach out to your vet or a CSAT to develop a plan that will work for your dog.*

# 1. Use a Crate (*Improperly*)

When looking online for advice for dealing with my dogs separation anxiety, lots of articles recommended I use a crate for him when I wasn’t home. I tried a wire crate, but he was so panicked when I departed that he would collapse the crate and escape, so I spent over $1,000 dollars to buy him a “high anxiety escape-proof” crate.

Moose had no previous experience being crated. He grew up as a stray and was never properly crate trained, meaning his first and only experience with a crate was when I was leaving the apartment. He learned to associate the crate with me leaving, and it soon became a trigger for his anxiety. 

If you plan on using a crate for your dogs separation anxiety, **do not use it only when you leave**. The proper way to crate train a dog involves having the dog spending time in the crate when you are home, and learning to relax, then slowly increasing the amount of time they spend in the crate alone. 

I did the worst thing imaginable by throwing him in the crate only when I left. He still will not go in the crate to this day.

# 2. Overexercise

Ever heard the phrase “*a tired dog is a happy dog*”? Me too. I took this sentiment to heart and began spending an hour plus each day trying to tired out my hound so that he can have some relief from the symptoms that plague him. It didn’t make a difference, and I was the only one actually tired by the end of the day.

Yes, exercise *is* important to keeping your dog happy and healthy, and can minimize some anxiety symptoms and behavioral issues. However, I found that for Moose, being **overtired** put him at a risk of throwing toddler-like tantrums and, at times, increasing the likelyhood of bigger anxiety episodes (contradicting, right?).

I’ve found that the best recipe for keeping my boy happy is a combination of “sniffari” walks, enrichment toys, and exercise. Check out my list of our [favorite enrichment toys](https://www.amazon.com/ideas/amzn1.account.AHVABFNCZKK7H3HDOJQWUZAETNOA/1K18JE81BBK5?type=explore&ref=idea_cp_vl_ov_d) on Amazon!

<Aside>
⭐ A **sniffari** is a slow paced walked, where the dog is allowed to sniff whatever (granted its safe for them) they please for as long as they please. For dogs, sniffing is one of the most mentally enriching activities they can preform. Adding these to our repertoire has helped tired Moose out, and save my legs and energy for the rest of the day.

# 3. Waiting to get Pet Insurance

Many pet insurers cover behavioral care of animals for issues like aggression and separation anxiety. One of the biggest things that keeps people from seeking assistance with their dogs behaviorial problems is the associated cost. Vetrinary Behaviorists are experts and as a result, appointments can cost hundreds of dollars. However, **they are worth every penny.**

We use a plan that reimburses 70% of covered vet costs — the only thing they don’t cover (besides basic wellness and vaccinations) is pre-existing conditions. If I could do things over, I would enroll in a pet insurance plan immediately after adopting my dog. There is a waiting period, so if behavioral issues arise (which often take around a month of the dog decompressing), you don’t have to sign up and wait any longer.

Moose and I recommend [Nationwide Pet Insurance](https://www.petinsurance.com). We are not sponsored, this is the insurance I pay for myself and have had a great experience with.

# 4. Waiting to Recruit Help

Moose and I’s CSAT (Certified Separation Anxiety Trainer) told us that after an anxiety episode, the stress hormones, like corisol and adrenaline, take nearly 72 hours to return to baseline. So every time you leave within that 72 hour window, the stress hormone levels “baseline” becomes higher and higher, resulting in larger panick reactions.

I specifically remember one evening trying to go out to dinner with some friends. I put my shoes on, grabbed my jacket and keys, then called Moose to get him into his crate. He looked at me, pulled his tail between his legs, jumped up onto the bed, layed down, and peed. Note - Moose is fully potty trained. I realized then, I needed help.

The thing is, I didn’t need to let his anxiety get this bad. I should have reached out for help sooner, because I was over my head. My recommendation is to meet with a CSAT as soon as you realize something is up, and schedule an appointment with a vetrinary behaviorist since it can take months to get in. This way, you can have an active training regime and be able to explain what has worked and what hasn’t when you get to the appointment.

# 5. Think that Medication will Fix All or Change my Dog’s Personality

When working with dogs with separation anxiety, something that comes up a lot is whether or not to medicate your dog. There are two common misconceptions about medication and how it would affect your dog

- Medication will change my pets personality
- Medication will fix all behavioral issues

Both, generally, are untrue. People have this preconcieved notion that their dog will be “drugged” or “stoned”, and not be their normal goofy selves. Many situational anxiety medications, like trazadone and clonidine, may have a sedative affect, but it only lasts a few hours, and doesn’t have major effects on their personality. Medications like fluoxitine (Reconcile) help to keep those stress hormones under control.

Another notion is that medication alone will fix the issues. This is *farthest* from the truth. The most beneficial thing you can do for your pup is **systemic desensitization** under the supervision of a CSAT. Medication, is just a helpful tool.

# 6. Blame Myself

When Moose’s separation anxiety started coming to light, I spent a lot of time upset with myself and believing my own actions caused him to have this fear. I thought that never leaving the home since I worked from home created this abadonment problem, or that the way I was leaving was too sudden or even that I didn’t spend more time training him when he first came into my home. In reality, there are a lot factors that play into including

1. **Genetics** - There are numerous studies indicating that separation anxiety has some sort of genetic component. Moose’s Vetrinary Behaviorist even told me that nearly 90% of the dogs she treats for separation anxiety are hounds or some sort of hound mix. While that is anecedotal, she works with tons of dogs like Moose on a daily basis so that definitely means something.
2. **Environmental** - Frequent environment changes, or being uprooted from thier family are frequent triggers for separation anxiety in dogs, putting rescue and shelter dogs at the highest risk for developing it. 

Find solace in the concept that you did not cause your dogs anxiety issues, but you can be the one who helps them through it.
