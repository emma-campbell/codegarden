          Hello üëãüèº My name is Emma. I am a 24 year old software engineer
          currently living in the DMV area. Nice to digitally meet you!

            I grew up wanting to be a doctor. No, seriously. I think medicine is
            fascinating and I was always enamoured with the idea of helping
            people. I spent some time in the classes, and I was enjoying the
            stuff I was learning. Biology and the human body are fascinating!
            Then, I got to chemistry. Yuck ü§Æ

            So, I switched. I had always thought outer space was cool, and I did
            well in physics in high school, so I decided to give physics and
            astronomy a try. I did well, and as a part of the course work I was
            required to take a class called &quot;Introduction to
            Programming&quot;. The class was in python, and I fell in love with
            it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-md text-white/70">
            So, I switched again. I decided to major in Computer Science.
            Besides learning to program, I grew to become well-versed in the
            theory that makes great software and even better at learning how to
            problem solve.

            During my senior year, I was diagnosed with Psoriatic Axial
            Spondyloarthitis. A mouthful, yes, but I had to learn how to manage
            a life altering condition. I knew I wanted to help others in
            predicaments like my own, so I joined{" "}
