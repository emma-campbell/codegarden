# Codegarden ðŸŒ±

My personal portfolio and blog interwebs existence. A codegarden is a digital space for a developer to grow and nourish themselves into the best programmer they can be.

## What's it Built With?

Wanna know what I used to build it without diving too far into the source code? Yeah?! Well, here you go.

* Static Site Rendering: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
* Deployment: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
* CMS/Content: [contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev)
* Styles: [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
* Database: [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com)
* ORM: [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)

Not to mention my blood, sweat, and tears. Maybe some banging my head on the table as well.

## Contributing

If you see an open issue and want to tackle it, please be my guest! I am happy to help you boast the number of repo's your contributing to (while, admittably there are other more import open-source projects to constribute to).
